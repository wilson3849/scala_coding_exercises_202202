# Scala practice

This repository contains challenges for you undertake to build on your coding and technical ability. We will be checking over your solutions, so please ensure you push to GitHub regularly.

You may find these exercises challenging but they give you the opportunity to build on your growth mindset and commitment to programming and learning in general. 

You can always come to us if you are having any trouble.

We will be covering Scala on the Your Return to Tech course, so it's really important your problem solving skills are fresh.

If this is your first time encountering the Scala language then firstly ðŸ™Œ ðŸ™Œ ðŸ™Œ to you for working through a new language. 

Secondly, we recommend working through the [Scala tour material on their website](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tour-of-scala.html) before working through the exercises.

## Instructions

Ok you're ready to get started. Here we'll provide instructions on how to get setup and work through the exercises.

To complete these exercises you will need to have Java and Scala installed on your computer.

### Installing Java

Follow the link below to download and install the **Java SE Development Kit** for your laptop. 

**NOTE:** At the time of writing it is recommended to install a Long Term Support (LTS) version of the Java Development Kit in order to ensure compatibility with Scala. At the time of writing (12/2021) version 11 is the most compatible (with Scala) LTS version of Java.  

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11

You should be able to verify your Java installation by running this command at the Terminal (MacOS/Linux) or Command prompt (Windows)

```
java --version
```

And you should see something similar to (note yours might be slightly different depending on how you installed Java)

```
openjdk 11.0.12 2021-07-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Homebrew (build 11.0.12+0)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Homebrew (build 11.0.12+0, mixed mode)
```

### Installing Scala

The next step is to install Scala. 

The Scala website provides instruction on installing the Scala tooling

**NOTE:** At the time of writing (12/2021) we recommend installing Scala version 2.

https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html#install-scala-on-your-computer

You should be able to verify your Scala installation by running this command at the Terminal (MacOS/Linix) or Command prompt (Windows)

```
scala --version
```

And you should see something similar to (note yours might be slightly different depending on how you installed Scala)

```
Scala code runner version 2.13.7 -- Copyright 2002-2021, LAMP/EPFL and Lightbend, Inc.
```

**NOTE:** Installing different pieces of software often feels like a painful part of picking up a new language. If you have any problems at all please do get in touch with us ðŸ™‚

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

There are various IDE tools you can utilise for writing Scala. 

At Tech Returners you'll see us use the [IntelliJ tool](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) for working with Scala.

The free community edition is more than sufficient for usage during the programme.

## Getting started

Once you've got Java and Scala installed you can make a start.

Before you do, please make sure to watch the getting [started video](https://storage.googleapis.com/your-return-to-tech/pre-journey/scala_getting_started.mp4) as it walks you through instructions for getting started and the first exercise.

Once you have had a watch of the video you can head over to [activity 1](./docs/activity_1.md)
