# Activity 3

This exercise is designed for you to explore arrays and unit testing in Scala.

### Instructions
Pip the cat would like to set up an ice cream store with the following ice cream flavours encoded below.

This is useful because it helps Pip identify the ice cream flavours without opening the ice cream tubs as that would ruin the ice cream.

- Pistachio: 0
- Raspberry Ripple: 1
- Vanilla: 2
- Mint Chocolate Chip: 3
- Chocolate: 4
- Mango Sorbet: 5

Pip has already made some starter code in [Exercise003.scala](../src/main/scala/com/techreturners/exercise003/Exercise003.scala).

Your job is to help Pip make the unit tests pass.

You'll see a number of unit tests in [Exercise003Test.scala](../src/test/scala/com/techreturners/exercise003/Exercise003Test.scala)

Feel free to structure your code however you prefer to solve the exercise.

We'd like to see clean code, so please keep clear separation of concerns, and the D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in mind.

### Extension Exercise

Add additional unit tests to [Exercise003Test.scala](../src/test/scala/com/techreturners/exercise003/Exercise003Test.scala)

### Moving on...

Once you've got all tests passing then it is time to move on to the final activity, [Activity 4](./activity_4.md)
