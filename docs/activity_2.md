# Activity 2

In this set of exercises we're going to explore the creation of your own objects.

### Instructions
You'll see a number of tests in [Exercise002Test.scala](../src/test/scala/com/techreturners/exercise002/Exercise002Test.scala)

You'll be required to create Scala objects (classes) to represent a "Person".

A Person has 4 properties/data associated with them:

* Their first name
* Their last name
* Their city
* Their age

You'll need to look at the methods and tests and update accordingly.

### Moving on...

Once you've got all tests passing then it is time to move on to [Activity 3](./activity_3.md)
